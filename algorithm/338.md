# Question

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.  

**Example:** 
For `num = 5` you should return `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`.

**Follow up:**  
* It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
* Space complexity should be O(n).
* Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

# solution (go)
```go
func countBits(num int) []int {
    i := 0
    var ret []int
    for i <= num {
        ret = append(ret, count1(i))
        i++
    }
    
    return ret
}

// 计算 n 的 bit 串中有几个 1
func count1(n int) int {
    var count1 int
    for n != 0 {
        count1++
        n &= (n-1)
    }
    return count1
}
```
