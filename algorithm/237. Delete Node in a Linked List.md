# #226. Invert Binary Tree

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is ```1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 ``` and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become ```1 -> 2 -> 4 ``` after calling your function.
<hr>  

### _*solution*_
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} node
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
 */
var deleteNode = function(node) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
};
```

### _*explantion*_
1. Cover the value of the current node by the value of the next node.
2. Free the next node
